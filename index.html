                                    My name is Israel Molestina. I was born in Ecuador and moved to the states when I was five. I’ve moved around quite a bit, eventually graduating high school in Chapel Hill NC, and attended University of North Carolina at Asheville. In Asheville I found a passion for leadership. My first year of living in Asheville I found myself as the manager of a small farm. Being responsible for livestock the grounds and a few other employees. Shortly thereafter I started work at a local cocktail bar as a barback. Within a year I moved up to bartender and then bar manager. Through these experiences I learned many skills including time and financial management. But the most important in my opinion is helping and uplifting those around me to their best potential. As a manager, I found it important to always help and encourage my employees. As opposed to some of the more traditional and stricter methods like micromanaging. Although I enjoyed my work and what came with it, the hours were grueling. Often 50+ hours a week and coming home at three or four in the morning. This was unsustainable for me and my family life.

                                    At home I had a partner and the best dog in the world, Titus. Working these hours, I was not able to spend enough time with them. When the pandemic hit, I decided to make a change. At the time I didn’t know what the change was. I tried a few different things that didn’t work out, until I finally took a few coding courses on Khan Academy. I quickly found a passion for coding which brought me to this bootcamp. I’ve had a few friends who had gone through the bootcamp and have found success outside of it. I don’t know yet where I want to go with this new skill set, but I am very excited for what the future holds. I am looking forward to progressing through this class, making connections along the way and seeing where it takes me!
