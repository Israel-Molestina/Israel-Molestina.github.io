# Responsive Portfolio
![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/Israel-Molestina/Israel-Molestina.github.io)

## The Application
I've created a mobile responsive portfolio webpage to showcase my projects and accomplishments. I used Bootstrap CSS Framework to create this responsive layout, along with my own CSS file for some of the finishing touches. 

### Within the application you will find
* A responsive layout
* Responsive images
* A consistent navbar accross each page
* Working links within the navbar to the About, Contact and Porfolio pages
* My personal bio, headshot, social media and projects
* A sticky header and footer

### Within the source code you will find
* Proper use of Bootstraps gid system
* Semantic and valid HTML
* No use of media queries as Bootstrap has minimized their need

## Below is the link to the finsished application along with a screenshot of each page
